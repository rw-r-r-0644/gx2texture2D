This is a sample application for rendering 2D textures on the Wii U GX2. It utilizes texture2D.gsh as its primary shader, which can be found in the Health and Safety application under /vol/content/shaders/texture2D.gsh (it is not included in this repo). The shader is modified at runtime to allow for a vertex color attribute which can be used for alpha transparency. This repo also includes template data for code, content and meta under **pack/**.
