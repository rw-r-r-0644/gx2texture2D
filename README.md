This is a sample application for rendering 2D textures on the Wii U GX2. It utilizes textureShader.gsh as its primary shader, an open source shader replacing texture2D.gsh (included in this repo, can be compiled with decaf-emu's latte assembler).
Based off gx2texture2D (https://github.com/shinyquagsire23/gx2texture2D).
